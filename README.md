# Project Title

Quick implementation of chess moves problem with bishop.

## Notes

I implemented using a TDD approach. I use eslint to enforce JavaScript Standard style.

## Dependencies

Built using Node v10.8.0.

## Installing

Assuming you have Node installed. Run NPM to install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Running the tests

Tests built with Mocha and Chai. I acknowledge a multiple assertions per test antipattern, but simply haven't taken the time yet to refactor.

```
npm test
```

## Running the sample app

The index.js file is the little client app to run the code. Edit as desired.

```
npm start
```
